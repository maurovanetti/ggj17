In that moment, the fog of memory unfolded before the sister.
She heard a conversation long since forgotten.
Nurse: “He rarely speaks.”
Sister: “Based on what he used to say, I consider it an improvement.”
Nurse: “Never moves.”
Sister: “Why should he? He’s got nothing to do.”
Nurse: “Eats only when forced.”
Sister: “And smokes his damned pipe the rest of the time.”
Nurse: “His sickness is called loneliness.”
Sister: “Or being a jerk.”
Nurse: “No wife.”
Sister: “No wonder.”
Nurse: “One daughter.”
Sister: “Poor her.”
Nurse: “Who never visits him.”
Sister: “He must be happy she doesn’t.”
Nurse: “You really should visit him, Sister.”
Sister: “You should visit him, instead. A pretty girl like you. He’d fall in love.”
Nurse: “I’m serious!”
Sister: “I’m serious too! What makes you think I want to see him in this state? What should I talk about? He doesn’t even speak.”
Sister: “Seeing his ‘superstitious, bigoted, irrational daughter’ will just make him angrier.”
Sister: “Even if he spoke, he’d just try to analyse my mind and that would make ME angrier.”
Sister: “You don’t know him, Nurse. He’s not a good man.”
Nurse: “…”
Nurse: “No person deserves to die alone.”
Sister: “He won’t die. He’ll just get the attention he’s begging for.”
…
“Something’s messing with my memories. How cliché.”
“Do we really have to go to the next area? I don’t think they sell marshmallows there.”
