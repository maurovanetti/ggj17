Sister: "Father!"
Father: "Don't go further, my dear."
Sister: "So you do speak, huh?"
Father: "I know I'm not a good father."
Sister: "..."
Father: "I hope I can just tell you some last things."
Sister: "Father... Quit this thing you're doing. Step down from there."
Father: "It's not your fault."
Sister: "STOP IT! STOP! COME HERE!"
Father: "Don't let the black shadows of guilt cloud your mind."
Sister: "Please..."
Father: "Just keep them away. Remember what you said when you were little? What are your two favourite things?"
Sister: "Music... And God..."
Father: "And I mocked your unintellectual aspirations."
Sister: "Never mind your mockery, father... It's not your fault."
Father: "Oh, but it is."
Sister: "No..."
Father: "And remember... I will always be in your head. To protect you from the shadows, even if you don't want me to, as a way to ask for forgiveness."
Sister: "I forgive you. God forgives you. Please stay!"
Father: "This is but a memory, my child. You can't change what happened. You just need to accept it. Goodbye."
